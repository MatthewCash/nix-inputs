= `git-crypt-hook`

Decrypts `git-crypt`-encrypted sources as part of `postUnpack`.

NOTE: `userSetupScript` runs after unpacking, so you have to use `preUnpack`
to write the private key.

Example:

```nix
effects.mkEffect {
  src = lib.cleanSource ./.;
  inputs = [ effects.git-crypt-hook ];
  preUnpack = ''
    writeGPGKey git-crypt
  '';
  secretsMap.git-crypt = "default-gpg";
```

The `src` attribute must include:

* the `.git-crypt` at the root
* the `.gitattributes` files
