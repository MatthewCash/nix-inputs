_runNixOps {two-colons} AttrSet -> Effect_

Provision interrelated machine configurations and other cloud resources.

For a practical introduction, check out the guide xref:guide/deploy-a-nixops-network.adoc[].


[[parameters]]
== `Parameters`

[[param-name]]
=== `name`

The NixOps deployment name.

[[param-src]]
=== `src`

NixOps network expressions and other files required for the deployment.
Unlike some other deployment methods, NixOps needs access to the actual expression files.

Confidential information should not be committed and included here, but inserted via
`secrets.json` and xref:reference/nix-functions/mkEffect.adoc#param-userSetupScript[`userSetupScript`].

[[param-networkFiles]]
=== `networkFiles`

Default: `["network.nix"]`

Files in `src` that are always used as network expressions.

[[param-prebuild]]
=== `prebuild`

Default: `true`

Whether to build the network during the Hercules CI build phase. This ensures
that all packages are in the cache and avoids attempting a deployment when
some packages can't be built.


[[param-prebuildOnlyNetworkFiles]]
=== `prebuildOnlyNetworkFiles`

Default: `[]`

xref:param-prebuild[Prebuild] runs outside of NixOps, which means that some info may be missing.
Specify extra network expressions here to fill in or override the missing definitions.

[[param-deployOnlyNetworkFiles]]
=== `deployOnlyNetworkFiles`

Default: `[]`

Network files that are only used when deploying; not when prebuilding.

[[param-stateName]]
=== `stateName`

Default: `"nixops-$\{name}.json"`

Override the Hercules CI state file name, in case it's necessary.

The state file only contains a single deployment.

[[param-knownHostsName]]
=== `knownHostsName`

Default: `"nixops-$\{name}.known_hosts"`

Some NixOps backends do not update the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file. `runNixOps`
will persist this file as a state file with the name set here.

[[param-secretsMap]]
=== `secretsMap`

See xref:reference/nix-functions/mkEffect.adoc#param-secretsMap[`secretsMap` in `mkEffect`]

[[param-userSetupScript]]
=== `userSetupScript`

See xref:reference/nix-functions/mkEffect.adoc#param-userSetupScript[`userSetupScript` in `mkEffect`]

[[param-NIX_PATH]]
=== `NIX_PATH`

Default: `"nixpkgs=${pkgs.path}"`, where `pkgs` is the Nixpkgs invocation that included the effects overlay.

Necessary for looking up `<nixpkgs>` or potentially other locations using angle bracket syntax.

[[param-action]]
=== `action`

Default: `"switch"`; performing a full deployment, analogous to `nixos-rebuild switch` but on all nodes and including resources.

Other valid values besides `"switch"` are `"dry-run"`, `"plan"`, `"build"`*, `"create"`, `"copy"`, `"dry-activate"`, `"test"`, `"boot"`.

Note that your agent will not automatically push to the cache for `build`. <<param-prebuild>> (enabled by default) does take care of this. See also xref:guide/deploy-a-nixops-network.adoc#prebuild[the NixOps deployment guide] on prebuilding.

[[extra-params]]
=== `...` -- remaining arguments

Other attributes are passed to xref:reference/nix-functions/mkEffect.adoc[mkEffect], which passes its remaining arguments to `mkDerivation`.

[[return-value]]
== Return value

An effect that performs the specified action on the NixOps deployment.

The effect has the following attributes in addition to the attributes returned
by xref:reference/nix-functions/mkEffect.adoc#return-value[`mkEffect`].


[[attr-prebuilt]]
=== `prebuilt`

A derivation representing the built system configuration.

[[attr-prebuilt.nodes]]
==== `prebuilt.nodes`

An attribute set containing the NixOS configurations of the prebuilt `nodes`.

This is primarily useful for inspection with `nix repl`.

[[attr-prebuilt.machineInfo]]
==== `prebuilt.machineInfo`

An attribute set with various attributes, including `resources`.

This is primarily useful for inspection with `nix repl`.
