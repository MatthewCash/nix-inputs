= `runIf`

_runIf {two-colons} Bool -> Effect -> AttrSet_

Make an effect conditional, but make always make sure it is buildable.

If the boolean condition evaluates to `true`, return a `run` attribute containing
the effect, so that it will be executed.

If the boolean condition is false, return a `dependencies` attribute to make sure
the effect's dependencies are buildable.

Regardless of the condition, return a `prebuilt` attribute if it is present on
the effect.
