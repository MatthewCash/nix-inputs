WARNING: Effects are in beta and require a recent `hercules-ci-agent` from the `master` branch.

This `hercules-ci-effects` repository provides useful abstractions and implementations to automate tasks such as deployment.

Hercules CI Effects as implemented by the agent are a fairly low-level interface
for executing programs that interact with the Nix store, centralized state, secrets and the real world.

`hercules-ci-effects` provides a standard library of both Nix and bash
functions. Its foundation is the `mkEffect` function, which extends
Nixpkgs' `stdenv` to handle the typical inputs and lifecycle of an effect.

Furthermore, it provides Nix functions that perform a number of common
deployment tasks, such as xref:reference/nix-functions/runNixOS.adoc[`runNixOS`] and xref:reference/nix-functions/runNixOps.adoc[`runNixOps`].

It also comes with a library of bash functions that help manage secrets,
configuration files and provide access to the state file API.
